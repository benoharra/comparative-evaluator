# Stock Industry Comparative Evaluator
This is a webapp designed to allow users to analyze 3-10 top stocks within an industry to determine which may be undervalued on the market currently. The application is designed to be collaborative so users can view, add to, and edit analyses performed by others on the app. Users should identify industries expected to perform above market value and/or use this tool to view how a particular stock stacks up against other top companies in its industry. Remember an analysis is only as accurate as the input data, so try to use the same sources for data on each stock's financial ratios.

Usage instructions will be updated as the app becomes operational. When ready, the app will be deployed to cloud servers to be accessed through a public URL.

This project is currenty in a developmental state and cannot be run as a full stack application for testing.
